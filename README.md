# Problem

    -There are many commercial centres located in main places.heavy traffic is caused by shopping activities there. 

    -There is no sufficient parking space in every commercial building. Provide a solution and make a smart parking system for the same issue.

We aim to provide Parking Space to users as well as security of their parkings is also kept in mind.
Apart from that our main USP is the idea of renting Parking space.
